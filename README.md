# iFatima-s_Interactive_Portfolio
After almost 105 hours, I present to you - "A simple 2D interactive portfolio to showcase my talent &amp; experiences :) "  I used Unity for the technical aspects of the game &amp; Gimp for all of the art. The art was mostly inspired by Stardew Valley.

Give it a try (web game: windows & Linux) at: https://inayatfatima.itch.io/ifatima-portfolio

Portfolio.zip holds the planning process, Personal_Portfolio is the entire unity project along with the first build
